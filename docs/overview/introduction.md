## What is Trakas?

> /**ËˆtrakÉ™s**/ â€” It cames from a name of *Poseidon's assistant*: Althea **Trakas**
> 
> This is JavaScript Utilities. As we hope it will be a useful assistant for Javascript's developers, like *assistant of a god*.

In any Javascript projects we've ever done, we realized that there are somethings that we have to write down over and over again.
Do you know what it is?

> Common code (snippets)
>
> [Snippet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snippet_(programming)) is a programming term for a small region of re-usable
> source code, machine code, or text.
> Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules.
> Snippet management is a feature of some text editors, program source code editors, IDEs, and related software.

So we decide to write it here, since we know that we have a better place for reference, and it will enhance the usability.

## Why Trakas, not some "Google works"?

In the beginning, We feel they are too small to be a package, just take some "google work" to find them out,
but for now We think it should be a package for better reasons:

1. A better place for reference
1. Enhance the usability
1. We can customize them with our own ideas to make them better.

We create basic snippets as we do in our projects. When become a good foundation, then we will have something bigger with it.

:::tip Any ideas?
If you have **any ideas or improvement for implementations**, pull requests will be welcomed.
When you've ever seen something you have to write it over and over again. Just tell us, then you have to write it only one time ðŸ˜‰
